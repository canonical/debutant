# Plan: language overlays for Python, Rust, Go, Perl

## Context

debutant ships as a phase-based plugin: `run` orchestrates
`bootstrap` / `refresh` / `lintian` / `autopkgtest`, all
coordinated by a shared context JSON and a prescriptive
`docs/house-style.md`. The plugin is **language-agnostic by
design today**: `source.language` is detected but no worker uses
that signal to apply language-specific Debian conventions
(pybuild, debcargo, dh-golang, dh-make-perl). For a maintainer
that means workers hand back a generic `dh $@` skeleton and
leave every language nuance to the human.

Other debian packaging agent skills do exist online. We chose to do things
our way both for licensing matters and to adhere to the house style we set.
Most of these productions are the consequence of a back and forth with Claude
and reviews/edition from Ubuntu or Debian Developers.

The goal of this pass: ship Python / Rust / Go / Perl
overlays so that the existing phase workers specialise their
output by detected language, **without expanding the skill
count or duplicating knowledge**.

## Decisions locked in with the user

1. **Overlay shape** — `docs/references/languages/<lang>.md`.
   Mirrors the existing `house-style.md` / `references/`
   pattern. Workers cite specific sections; no per-language
   skill; no duplication.
2. **Scope** — Python, Rust, Go, **Perl** (drafted from public
   Debian Perl Group knowledge — no upstream content to lean
   on). Ruby deferred.
3. **Templates** — yes to per-language `rules.tmpl` variants
   (`rules.python.tmpl`, `rules.rust.tmpl`, `rules.golang.tmpl`,
   `rules.perl.tmpl`). Bootstrap selects by `source.language`.
4. **Workers** — bootstrap, refresh, autopkgtest. `lintian`
   deferred.
5. **License** — no licence chosen yet for debutant; commit 1
   ships a placeholder LICENSE. The clean-redesign approach
   means licence selection is independent of this plan.
6. **Fixtures** — `tests/fixtures/*` are stubs by design. A
   future pass will promote all of them together (upstream
   source + `expected/debian/` + `test.sh`). This plan does
   **not** add per-commit fixture assertions; that was a
   misread of the harness, corrected during execution.

## Commit-by-commit roadmap

Each commit is atomic and reviewable in isolation. Commits 1–4
introduce shared infrastructure; commits 5–8 plug in one
language each; commits 9–11 are polish.

### ✅ Commit 1 — `legal: add LICENSE placeholder`
**Done.** Added a 17-line placeholder LICENSE noting no formal
licence is yet chosen, asking reviewers not to redistribute,
and stating contributions will be relicensable. No NOTICE
(clean-room redesign means no upstream attribution required).

### ✅ Commit 2 — `bootstrap: introduce language-keyed template dispatch`
**Done.** `skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md` grew:
- New `### Language dispatch` subsection with the
  `source.language` → template-file mapping table. Falls back
  to `rules.tmpl` for unknown languages.
- New `language` scalar in the variables table.
- New bail-out condition for Rust library crates (Cargo
  manifest with `[lib]` and no `[[bin]]`).

### ✅ Commit 3 — `refresh: scaffold language-aware audit section`
**Done.** New `## Language-aware audit` section in
`skills/refresh/SKILL.md` with per-language TBD stubs. Notes
that language-aware checks do not introduce new flags; they
ride on `--watch-v5` / `--dh-sequence` / etc.

### ✅ Commit 4 — `autopkgtest: add autodep8 Testsuite shortcut section`
**Done.** New `## Autodep8 shortcuts` section in
`skills/autopkgtest/SKILL.md` listing python / perl / ruby /
nodejs generators, with the explicit note that **no autodep8
generator exists for Rust or Go**. Process step 3 amended to
consider the shortcut first.

### ✅ Commit 5 — `python: language overlay, rules template, worker wiring`
**Done.** Files:
- `docs/references/languages/python.md` — interpreter/shebang
  policy, package naming (import name vs PyPI dist name), file
  layout, `debian/control` build-dep template, `debian/rules`
  pybuild pattern, watch v5 with `Template: pypi` (using
  `Dist:` field, downloads via pypi.debian.net), autopkgtest
  autodep8 nuances, wheels policy, Sphinx, refresh checks,
  iteration budget, bail-outs.
- `skills/bootstrap/templates/rules.python.tmpl` — `PYBUILD_NAME`
  export + `dh $@ --buildsystem=pybuild` + hardening gate.
- Worker SKILL.md edits: bootstrap Process step 4 anchor;
  `pybuild_name` scalar; refresh Python stub filled in;
  autopkgtest Python stub filled in.

### ✅ Commit 6 — `rust: language overlay, rules template, worker wiring`
**Done.** Files:
- `docs/references/languages/rust.md` — library-crate-vs-
  application-binary decision tree up front; debcargo path
  (bootstrap bail-out, debcargo.toml essentials, versioning,
  dependency-graph leaf-first ordering); dh-cargo path
  (build-deps, `rules`, `Cargo.lock`, watch v5 + `Template:
  github`); no autodep8; refresh checks; bail-outs.
- `skills/bootstrap/templates/rules.rust.tmpl` — minimal
  `dh $@ --buildsystem=cargo` with hardening flag.
- Worker SKILL.md edits: bootstrap Process step 4 anchor +
  library-crate bail-out gains a § link; refresh Rust stub
  filled in. (Autopkgtest unchanged — the "no autodep8 for
  Rust" line landed in commit 4.)

### 🔲 Commit 7 — `golang: language overlay, rules template, worker wiring`
**Not started.** Per plan: ship
`docs/references/languages/golang.md` (dh-golang, vendor
decisions, `0.0~git<date>.<hash>-1` versioning, github watch
template, multi-arch placement, `DH_GOLANG_INSTALL_EXTRA`) and
`skills/bootstrap/templates/rules.golang.tmpl` (`dh $@
--buildsystem=golang --with=golang`); fill in the Go anchors in
bootstrap/refresh; autopkgtest already states no Go autodep8.

### 🔲 Commit 8 — `perl: drafted overlay, rules template, worker wiring`
**Not started.** Per plan: draft
`docs/references/languages/perl.md` from public Debian Perl
Group knowledge (with a DRAFT marker awaiting pkg-perl review)
covering package naming (`libfoo-bar-perl`), architecture
choice, dh-make-perl as a comparison run in `/tmp` only, build
deps (`libmodule-build-tiny-perl`, test libs), file layout
(`/usr/share/perl5/`), watch v5 + `Template: metacpan`,
autopkgtest-pkg-perl autodep8. Ship
`skills/bootstrap/templates/rules.perl.tmpl` (minimal `dh $@`).
Fill in Perl anchors in bootstrap / refresh / autopkgtest. No
new fixture in this commit (deferred to the fixture-promotion
pass; see "Decisions" §6).

### 🔲 Commit 9 — `developer: document language-overlay recipe`
**Not started.** Add an "Adding a language overlay" § to
`docs/developer.md` walking through the recipe used in commits
5–8, referencing the four shipped overlays as worked examples.

### 🔲 Commit 10 — `house-style: add language-overlay drift to quarterly review`
**Not started.** Extend the quarterly-review checklist in
`docs/house-style.md` with per-language drift items: pybuild
major version, dh-golang major version, debcargo workflow
changes, perl version transitions. One bullet per language.

### 🔲 Commit 11 — `version: bump to 0.2.0, surface overlays in README`
**Not started.** Bump `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` to 0.2.0;
update `README.md` coverage summary to list the four language
overlays + the bootstrap template variants.

## Where we paused

End of commit 6. Resume by starting commit 7 (Go overlay).

The user-side workflow is one commit at a time: tool shows the
diff, user reviews and commits, then says "next" / "done" to
move on. No tool commit was made by the agent. Plan and progress
both live in this file from now on.

## Resume notes

- The original plan file at `~/.claude/plans/this-repository-contains-a-purring-clarke.md`
  has the longer-form version (audits of both repos, alternative
  designs considered, exhaustive verification section). This
  file is the operational artefact.
- Two factual corrections came up during commit 5 that future
  language overlays should respect:
  - Watch v5 `Template: pypi` uses `Dist:`, not `Source:`.
  - PyPI watch templates download via `pypi.debian.net` —
    there is no template for direct `pypi.org` downloads.
- The user prefers neutral-toned overlays (Rust overlay tones
  down Rust-team-process flavour; Perl overlay should do the
  same on pkg-perl conventions — mention, do not prescribe).
- Templates intentionally stay minimal — see
  `rules.python.tmpl` (10 lines) and `rules.rust.tmpl` (8
  lines). The overlay docs carry the depth; the templates are
  just enough to differentiate the dispatch.
- No upstream-attribution headers in any of the language
  overlays (clean-room redesign decision).

## Out of scope (deferred follow-ups)

- Promoting `tests/fixtures/*` from stubs (upstream tree +
  `expected/debian/` + `test.sh`) — a separate pass covering
  all fixtures together.
- Ruby overlay — deferred; the generator works via
  autopkgtest-pkg-ruby without an overlay, and Ruby is lower-
  priority than the four shipped here.
- `lintian` worker language overlays — deferred; most lintian
  tags are language-neutral, so the delta is smaller than for
  bootstrap/refresh.
- Node.js, Java, Haskell, OCaml overlays — architecture is now
  in place; each is a copy-paste of the developer.md recipe
  (commit 9) once it lands.
- Hardening audit (`blhc`), M-A coinstall verification,
  salsa-ci troubleshooting helper, Ubuntu-specific sub-skills.
